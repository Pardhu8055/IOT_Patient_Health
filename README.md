IOT BASED PATIENT HEALTH MONITORING SYSTEM USING RASPBERRY PI
->  Ecs report file consists of the Diagrams and output result with Html code to deploy in the clod to stream and surf
->  Developed using Raspberry Pi, DHT22 temperature monitoring sensor ,MAX30100 heartrate and blood oxygen 
monitoring sensor and an interface using HTML/CSS.

    ->  The design and implementation of a health monitoring system using IoT. 
    ->  This IoT-based device allows users to determine their health parameters, which could help regulate their health over time.
    ->  Eventually, the patients could seek medical assistance if the need arises. They could easily share their health parameter data instantly within one application with the doctor. 
    ->  As we know, the IoT is now considered one of the most desirable solutions in health monitoring. It makes sure that the parameter data is secured inside the cloud, and the most important thing is that any doctor can monitor the health of any patient at any distance.
    ->  This about an IoT-based health monitoring system using Raspberry pi that has been developed. The system will measure a patient’s body temperature, heartbeat, and the Oxygen levels in the blood and send the data to webpage. 
    ->  This information is also transmitted to the LCD panel, allowing the patient to see their current health state quickly.
    ->  Elderly patients, asthma patients, COPD patients, patients with chronic diseases, COVID-19 patients, and diabetic patients will be able to keep their health in check over time with the help of the system we developed.
    ->  The sensors used in the system can be improved, and we can measure several health parameters when additional sensors are added.
    ->  The video feature can be added for face-to-face consultation between the doctors and patients.
    ->  Some more measures which are very significant to determine a patient’s condition like the level of diabetes, respiration monitoring, etc. can be addressed as future work.
    ->  The data, consisting medical history of many patients’ parameters and corresponding results, can be explored using data mining, in search of consistent patterns and systematic relationships in the disease.
    ->  For instance, if a patient’s health parameters are changing in the same pattern as those of a previous patient in the database, the consequences can also be estimated. If the similar patterns are found repeatedly, it would be easier for the doctors and medical researchers to find a remedy for the problem.
